# Cockroach Detecting Neural Network
code:
- Appendices.pdf is a document containing more data related to the neural network, specifically many more heat maps that illustrate its key features.
- LibModel1L.py is a module which includes support code to train, run, evaluate, and debug the network. shrink322.tgz is my image dataset.
- The NN_and_Heat_Maps.ipynb jupyter notebook first trains the neural network, runs it, and outputs its metric results. Then it generates heat maps for specific images.
  - The heat map code outputs an array of heat maps for each layer. Currently there are 5 image paths at the begining of this code, 1 verification image, 1 true negative, 1 false hit, 1 true positive, and 1 miss.
